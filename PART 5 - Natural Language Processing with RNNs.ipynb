    "In the previous parts (PART1-> PART4 : view here https://github.com/Dahamey/Tensorflow-projects/tree/main), we focused on data that we could represent as one **static data point** where the notion of time or step was irrelevant. Take for example our image data, it was simply a tensor of shape (width, height, channels). That data doesn't change or care about the notion of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at sequences of text and learn how we can encode them in a meaningful way. Unlike images, sequence data such as long chains of text, weather patterns, videos and really anything where the notion of a step or time is relevant needs to be processed and handled in a special way.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, since textual data contains many words that follow in a very specific and meaningful order, we need to be able to keep track of each word and when it occurs in the data. Simply encoding say an entire paragraph of text into one data point wouldn't give us a very meaningful picture of the data and would be very difficult to do anything with. This is why we treat text as a sequence and process one word at a time. We will keep track of where each of these words appear and use that information to try to understand the meaning of pieces of text.\n"

    "Now that we've learned a little bit about how we can encode text it's time to dive into RNNs. Up until this point we have been using something called **feed-forward** neural networks. This simply means that all our data is fed forwards (all at once) from left to right through the network. This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for processing text. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right (or right to left in arabic) and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. Well, this is exactly what a RNN is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network, all we really mean is **a network that contains a loop**. A RNN will process one word at a time while maintaining an internal memory of what it's already seen. This will allow it to treat words differently based on their order in a sentence and to slowly build an understanding of the entire input, one word at a time.\n",
